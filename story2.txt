Here is our story written by Sarah and with contributions from Gabe and Anish. There once was a group of CS students working on their assignments for CS400. The deadline was fast approaching and the students were worried they wouldn't get their assignment in on time. They stayed late in the CS building, furiously typing on their keyboards and pushing to github every minute. All was going to plan until something unusual happened. All at once their computers become unresponsive and lines of code flood their screens. The students try every keyboard combination they can think of, unplug and replug every wire they can find but to no avail. Moments later their screens go black and the face of Chancellor Becky materializes on the projector screen.
